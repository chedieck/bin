# Custom scripts

Don't expect anything here to be reproducible, readable or even working. I use most of the stuff you can find here, but I keep legacy scripts from a time where I didn't knew a good tool/ good way to do X and so I coded X myself, clumsly. A lot of stuff here is very simple, a lot of stuff is way too complex. This isn't meant for you, but I like to keep it git tracked and don't see why I shouldn't share with whoever takes interest.
